# Electric-Vehicle-Adoption-Energy-Trends-Analysis
This project analyzes EV adoption trends across U.S. states, exploring the impact of government policies, financial incentives, and energy generation (fossil fuels vs. renewables). Using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly), we uncover insights into EV growth, energy shifts, and policy effectiveness.
