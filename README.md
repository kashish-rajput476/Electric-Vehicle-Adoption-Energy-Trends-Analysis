# 🚗🔋 Electric Vehicle Adoption & Energy Trends Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends** across U.S. states, analyzing how **energy generation, government policies, and incentives** impact EV growth. Using **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)**, we uncover key insights on EV registrations and renewable energy trends from **1990 to 2019**.  

## 📊 Key Objectives  
- 📍 **Analyze** U.S. state-wise EV registrations.  
- ⚡ **Explore** energy generation trends (fossil fuels vs. renewables).  
- 🏛 **Assess** the impact of policies & incentives on EV adoption.  
- 🔍 **Visualize** trends & correlations using Python libraries.  

## 🔑 Key Findings  
✅ States with strong **EV policies** (California, New York) have **higher adoption rates**.  
✅ **Financial incentives** (tax credits, rebates) drive EV sales more than renewable energy production.  
✅ A **shift from coal to renewables** started post-2008, with wind & solar gaining traction.  
✅ Energy generation has shown **steady growth**, influenced by policy changes & tech advancements.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Data Visualization & Statistical Analysis**  

## 📂 Dataset Sources  
📍 **EV Registrations (2018)** – U.S. state-wise EV adoption data.  
📍 **Energy Generation (1990-2019)** – Historical data on fossil fuels & renewables.  
📍 **State Codes** – Standardized state identifiers.  

## 📈 Visualizations  
🔹 **EV Registration Distribution** – Identifies high-adoption states.  
🔹 **Energy Generation Trends** – Fossil fuels vs. renewables over the years.  
🔹 **Policy Impact Analysis** – Government incentives vs. EV adoption.  
🔹 **Top Energy-Generating States** – States leading in power production.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- 📊 **Predictive Modeling** – Forecasting future EV adoption trends.  
- 🏛 **Policy Effectiveness Analysis** – Evaluating government incentives.  
- 🌍 **Renewable Energy Integration** – Linking EV growth with sustainable energy sources.  

## 💡 Conclusion  
🔹 EV adoption is **policy-driven**, not just dependent on energy availability.  
🔹 Renewable energy is rising, but **infrastructure & affordability remain key challenges**.  
🔹 Data-driven decision-making can **help shape sustainable transportation policies**.
